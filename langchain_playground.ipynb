It involves retrieving relevant information from a large database or knowledge graph and using it to guide the generation of new text, resulting in more coherent and informative text output. RAG is often used in question-answering systems and chatbots, where the retrieved information can be used to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries. This technique has shown promising results in various NLP tasks, such as text summarization, dialogue generation, and open-domain question answering. '"
